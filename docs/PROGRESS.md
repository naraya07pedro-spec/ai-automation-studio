# Progress Log

This log records work completed in the repository. A product decision is not implementation.

## Slice 01 · 2026-11-03 · Product baseline and scope

**Goal:** Preserve the agreed product direction before choosing technologies.

**Completed**
- Verified the initial repository state: README and MIT LICENSE only.
- Added `docs/PRODUCT_BASELINE.md` with product decisions D01–D35.
- Documented safety, privacy, reliability, offline and data-ownership constraints.
- Marked a lead-inquiry automation vertical as a **proposal**, not a locked implementation plan.

**Verification**
- Confirm the baseline file is present on the review branch.
- Check all 35 IDs exist and remain in order.
- Check this change contains documentation only; no application or CI tests exist yet.

**Not completed**
- No functional AI agent, editor, connectors, runtime, dashboard, deployment, or automated tests.
- No architecture or stack decision.
- No changes to `main` until reviewed and merged.

**Next small slice (proposed):** Write an executable acceptance checklist for a single safe lead-inquiry workflow, covering input validation, idempotency, permission checks, mock-only testing, and observable outcomes. Do not implement broad features in one pass.

## Reporting rule for future slices

Each slice must report: goal, exact files changed, checks run and their results, unresolved risks, next smallest step, branch/PR/merge status. Never mark work completed without verifying the artifact.

# Progress Log

This log records work completed in the repository. A product decision is not implementation.

## Slice 01 · 2026-11-03 · Product baseline and scope

**Goal:** Preserve the agreed product direction before choosing technologies.

**Completed**
- Verified the initial repository state: README and MIT LICENSE only.
- Added `docs/PRODUCT_BASELINE.md` with product decisions D01–D35.
- Documented safety, privacy, reliability, offline and data-ownership constraints.
- Marked a lead-inquiry automation vertical as a **proposal**, not a locked implementation plan.

**Verification**
- Confirm the baseline file is present on the review branch.
- Check all 35 IDs exist and remain in order.
- Check this change contains documentation only; no application or CI tests exist yet.

**Not completed**
- No functional AI agent, editor, connectors, runtime, dashboard, deployment, or automated tests.
- No architecture or stack decision.
- No changes to `main` until reviewed and merged.

**Next small slice (proposed):** Write an executable acceptance checklist for a single safe lead-inquiry workflow, covering input validation, idempotency, permission checks, mock-only testing, and observable outcomes. Do not implement broad features in one pass.

## Reporting rule for future slices

Each slice must report: goal, exact files changed, checks run and their results, unresolved risks, next smallest step, branch/PR/merge status. Never mark work completed without verifying the artifact.


## Slice 02 · 2026-11-03 · Lead inquiry acceptance contract

**Goal:** Turn the proposed first business vertical into clear, independently checkable behavior without choosing a tech stack.

**Completed**
- Added `docs/LEAD_INQUIRY_ACCEPTANCE.md` with a 10-stage journey and 18 labeled acceptance scenarios (AC01–AC18).
- Distinguished execution state, optional AI memory, business knowledge, and protected secrets.
- Specified mock-first tests, risk-gated live integrations, permission checks, outcome uncertainty and redacted evidence.
- Identified initial non-goals and open integration-specific questions; did not pretend mock tests validate real APIs.

**Verification**
- Read back the committed document from the slice branch.
- Confirm AC01–AC18 are present in order; verify explicit distinction between mock and live verification.
- Docs-only change; no automated application tests exist or were run.

**Not completed**
- No code implementing the workflow, test harness, credentials, connectors, model routing, or UI.
- No live customer or external API action.
- This slice remains in a review PR until merged.

**Next small slice (proposed):** Define a strict, provider-neutral mock event fixture and expected action/outcome samples for AC01–AC04. Only after that, select the minimal executable toolchain and implement the smallest testable behavior.


## Slice 03 · 2026-11-03 · Synthetic fixture contracts AC01–AC04

**Goal:** Add reusable, synthetic input/expected-output examples for the first four lead-inquiry acceptance scenarios, before implementing application behavior.

**Completed**
- Added `fixtures/lead_inquiry_ac01_ac04.json` with AC01 valid mock setup, AC02 missing mapping block, AC03 duplicate source event, and AC04 unknown qualification field.
- Added `tools/validate_fixture_contract.py`, a Python standard-library-only checker for fixture consistency. This is test tooling, **not** an application language or stack choice.
- All expected dispatch counts are zero. No credentials, customer records, or provider endpoints were used.

**Verification performed**
- Ran an equivalent local fixture checker against synthetic fixtures: positive fixture validation passed.
- Three negative mutations were correctly rejected locally: inconsistent duplicate count, missing fact falsely marked verified, and nonzero mock external dispatch count.
- Read both new files back from the GitHub review branch; confirmed AC01–AC04 order, mock-only inputs, and zero expected external dispatches.
- **Not yet verified:** the committed checker has not run in a GitHub CI environment, and no application implementation exists. Static fixture checks do **not** demonstrate runtime correctness.

**Not completed**
- No real lead processing engine, persistent idempotency, approval service, connector, message send, or UI.
- No production or real API activity.
- `main` is unchanged by this slice until its PR is merged.

**Next smallest slice (proposed):** Introduce a minimal executable mock behavior for just AC01–AC02 (validate configured fields and reject missing mapping), with unit tests comparing actual outputs against these fixtures. Confirm application/toolchain choices independently rather than treating the fixture validator as architecture.
